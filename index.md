- Python
- API
- Data wrangling
- Data visualisation
- Statistics

This is a mini project I did for my IOD Data Science and AI certificate using Python and Jupyter Notebook. In this project, we collect data from the World Bank V2 Indicators API, for more than 150 countries across 40 years. We performed cross-sectional and time-series analyses to examine how CO2 emission is affected by various development indicators.
